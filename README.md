# EntityOnView
This plugin tries to optimize user experience with naturally spawned entities by restricting where an entity can spawn. Only entities that (can be seen)/seen by a player will be spawned.

<sub>Scructure entities are not included because it is not considered natural but chunk generated entities.</sub>

*Realistic* method of this repo is taken from ***[Sentinel](https://github.com/mcmonkeyprojects/Sentinel)***
